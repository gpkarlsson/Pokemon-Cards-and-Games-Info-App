## Description
Utilizing the PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/) as well as the Pokemon TCG Developers API (https://pokemontcg.io/), we created an application that provides information to the user about Pokemon from the videogames, as well as information about specific sets of Pokemon Cards. We built this project not only out of our own desire to learn about making a functional front-end application, but also as a tool to quickly access specific information about Pokemon in general. Through building this application, we learned not only about the wealth of data that can be provided by APIs, but also about the potential advantages and challenges of working together in a group setting.
